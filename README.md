# Threads
The app is all about matching people having similar interests while maintaining complete anonymity. This project is made during **[HackJaipur Hackathon](https://hackjaipur.com/)** under the Diversity theme: Diversity means the inclusion of all individuals as technology does not discriminate. How can technology help to increase diversity and maintain it?  
  

## Moto behind this App
In the world of development, people are always busy with their workload and daily routines. Due to maintaining professionalism across the social media platforms, they should share professional thoughts or inspiring quotations they were not able to post or share what they really want. Even not able to talk to anyone openly cause of shyness of what they think about me.

We all have trouble with sharing our thoughts, emotions, confessions, secret crushes, adult jokes and conversations without the eye-popping reactions of friends, family and everyone on the chatting portals. Moreover, modern chat apps and networking tools have become too personalized for guys and girls all over the world wanting to have the freedom to chat without judgement. We all feel spied by colleagues and family members under a huge magnifying glass.

For that Thread creates aliases with awesome avatars for a perfect roleplay and making friends. So now you can freely express yourself. Meet random foreign people across the globe. Here you can confess, be honest, ask questions. Share secrets, date interesting people or just kill time. Nobody will judge you, as nobody can find out your real name. Find your secret identity in our anonymous chat app. Reveal yourself to the world the way you want.

## How it works
**Threads** is organized by your point of interest as per your selection it suggests you, anonymous friends. Whatever you are passionate about, we have a companion for you. For example Technology, Games, Sports, Education, Politics, etc. After you find a couple of like-minded people like you, then you can start chatting with them.
